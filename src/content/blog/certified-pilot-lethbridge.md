## Navigating the Skies Legally and Safely

Operating drones for commercial purposes, especially near controlled airspace like Lethbridge Airport (YQL), requires more than just technical skill—it demands strict adherence to Transport Canada regulations and proper certification. At Coalbanks Creative, we ensure your drone projects are not only visually stunning but also fully compliant with the law.

## Why Certification is Essential

Hiring a certified drone operator isn’t just a legal requirement—it’s a safeguard for your business. Here’s why:

- **Legality:** Certified pilots hold an Advanced Operations Pilot Certificate, which is mandatory for flying in controlled airspace or near airports like YQL. Without it, your project could face fines or delays.
- **Safety:** Advanced training covers risk assessment, emergency procedures, and safe flight practices, minimizing hazards for your team, property, and the public.
- **Expertise:** Certified operators bring technical knowledge and flight skills honed through rigorous testing, ensuring your project is handled professionally.

Choosing an uncertified operator might seem like a shortcut, but it risks your project’s success—and your business’s reputation.

## Compliance Unlocks Opportunity

While regulations may seem restrictive, compliance opens the door to advanced operations. Certified pilots can legally perform tasks like Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flights or operations in restricted areas (with proper permissions), giving your business access to cutting-edge aerial services. At Coalbanks Creative, we turn these possibilities into reality—safely and legally.

## Local Knowledge, Professional Results

Lethbridge’s unique airspace and weather conditions require a drone operator who knows the area inside and out. Coalbanks Creative’s certified pilots are not only experts in drone laws but also familiar with local permitting processes and airspace considerations around YQL. This ensures your project runs smoothly, without unexpected hurdles.

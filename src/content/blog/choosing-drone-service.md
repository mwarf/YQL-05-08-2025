## Making the Right Choice

Selecting a drone service provider is an important decision. Ensuring you partner with a qualified, professional, and reliable operator is key to a successful project outcome.

## Essential Questions to Ask

Before hiring, consider asking potential providers:

1.  **Are you Transport Canada Certified?** Request proof of their Pilot Certificate (Advanced Operations is typically required for most commercial work, especially in controlled airspace).
2.  **Do you carry liability insurance?** Ask for details about their coverage specific to drone operations.
3.  **Can I see your portfolio?** Review examples of their past work relevant to your project type.
4.  **What equipment do you use?** Understand if their drones and cameras meet the quality requirements for your project.
5.  **What is your safety record and process?** Inquire about their pre-flight checks, risk assessment procedures, and emergency plans.
6.  **Do you have experience with similar projects?** Specific experience in your industry (e.g., real estate, construction, events) is valuable.

## Why It Matters

Asking these questions helps ensure you partner with a provider like Coalbanks Creative who prioritizes safety, legality, and quality, giving you peace of mind and delivering superior results for your aerial imaging needs.

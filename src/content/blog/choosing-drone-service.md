## Making the Right Choice

Selecting a drone service provider is an important decision that can make or break your project. Whether you’re capturing aerial footage for real estate, monitoring a construction site, or showcasing Lethbridge’s stunning coulees, partnering with a qualified, professional, and reliable operator ensures your vision comes to life—safely and legally. In a city like Lethbridge, where controlled airspace around Lethbridge Airport (YQL) and unpredictable winds add complexity, the right provider is even more critical.

At Coalbanks Creative, we’re committed to delivering exceptional results while prioritizing compliance and quality. Here’s how to choose a drone service provider you can trust.

## Essential Questions to Ask

Before hiring a drone service provider, ask these key questions to ensure they meet the standards your project demands:

1. **Are you Transport Canada Certified?**  
   - **What to ask:** Request proof of their Pilot Certificate—specifically, an Advanced Operations certificate, which is required for most commercial work, especially in controlled airspace like YQL.  
   - **Why it matters:** As of 2025, Transport Canada mandates this certification for flights in restricted areas or near people, with additional training for advanced operations like Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). Non-certified operators face fines up to $3,000, and your project could be grounded.  
   - **Pro tip:** Verify their certificate is current and ask if they’ve completed the latest BVLOS or complex operations training—crucial for larger Lethbridge projects.

2. **Do you carry liability insurance?**  
   - **What to ask:** Ask for details about their coverage specific to drone operations, including the amount and scope.  
   - **Why it matters:** Accidents happen—drones can malfunction or cause property damage. Insurance protects your business from liability, with $1 million being the industry standard for commercial work.  
   - **Pro tip:** Confirm their policy is active and covers your project type—some insurers exclude high-risk areas like airports or industrial zones.

3. **Can I see your portfolio?**  
   - **What to ask:** Review examples of their past work relevant to your project type, whether it’s real estate, agriculture, or events.  
   - **Why it matters:** A strong portfolio demonstrates skill and experience. For Lethbridge clients, look for projects that showcase local landmarks like the High Level Bridge or rural fields—they’ll reflect familiarity with the area’s unique terrain and lighting.  
   - **Pro tip:** Ask for video or photo samples from windy days—common in Lethbridge—to ensure their work holds up under challenging conditions.

4. **What equipment do you use?**  
   - **What to ask:** Understand if their drones and cameras meet the quality requirements for your project, like 4K resolution or thermal imaging.  
   - **Why it matters:** Professional-grade equipment ensures crisp, stable footage. Drones with obstacle avoidance and GPS stabilization are especially important in Lethbridge’s gusty winds or near structures.  
   - **Pro tip:** Inquire about backup gear—reliable providers carry spares to avoid delays if equipment fails mid-flight.

5. **What is your safety record and process?**  
   - **What to ask:** Inquire about their pre-flight checks, risk assessment procedures, and emergency plans—especially for flights near YQL or populated areas.  
   - **Why it matters:** A solid safety record shows they prioritize risk management, critical in a regulated environment like Canada. Transport Canada requires detailed safety protocols, but top providers tailor them to each site.  
   - **Pro tip:** Ask if they’ve handled flights in controlled airspace before—experience with NAV CANADA approvals is a big plus in Lethbridge.

6. **Do you have experience with similar projects?**  
   - **What to ask:** Confirm they’ve worked on projects in your industry, like real estate flyovers, construction progress shots, or tourism promotions.  
   - **Why it matters:** Industry-specific experience means they understand your goals—like highlighting a property’s layout or capturing seasonal changes in Lethbridge’s landscape. Local knowledge is a bonus for navigating regional challenges.  
   - **Pro tip:** For agriculture clients, ask about experience with crop monitoring—drones with multispectral cameras can add value here.

## Why It Matters

Asking these questions isn’t just due diligence—it’s your safeguard against costly mistakes. Partnering with a provider like Coalbanks Creative, who prioritizes safety, legality, and quality, gives you peace of mind and delivers superior results for your aerial imaging needs. In 2025, Transport Canada tightened drone regulations, especially near controlled airspace like YQL, where operators must secure permissions and maintain strict compliance. A certified provider ensures your project stays airborne and on budget.

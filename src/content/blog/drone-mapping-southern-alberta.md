## Data from the Sky

Drones aren't just for capturing stunning visuals; they are powerful tools for collecting precise geospatial data. Drone mapping, using techniques like photogrammetry and LiDAR, creates detailed orthomosaics, 3D models, and elevation maps crucial for various industries in Southern Alberta.

## Applications Across Sectors

*   **Construction:** Monitor site progress, calculate earthwork volumes, conduct as-built surveys, and improve safety planning.
*   **Agriculture:** Analyze crop health, optimize irrigation, plan drainage, and assess land topography for precision farming.
*   **Land Management:** Map environmental changes, manage resources, plan infrastructure projects, and conduct property surveys.

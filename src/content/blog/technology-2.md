## Capturing the World in 3D

Both LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and Photogrammetry are powerful techniques used by drones to create detailed 3D models and maps of environments. However, they work differently and excel in different scenarios.

## Photogrammetry: The Power of Pictures

Photogrammetry uses overlapping photographs taken from various angles. Software then analyzes these images, identifying common points to calculate depth and reconstruct a 3D model or orthomosaic map.

*   **Pros:** Cost-effective (uses standard cameras), produces realistic textures and colors.
*   **Cons:** Can struggle with uniform surfaces or dense vegetation, sensitive to lighting conditions.

## LiDAR: Precision with Light Pulses

LiDAR systems emit laser pulses and measure the time it takes for the reflections to return. This directly measures distances, creating a highly accurate point cloud of the surveyed area.

*   **Pros:** Extremely accurate, penetrates vegetation to map the ground beneath, works well in various lighting conditions.
*   **Cons:** More expensive equipment, point clouds lack inherent color/texture (often fused with photos).

## Choosing the Right Tool

For projects requiring high accuracy, vegetation penetration (like forestry or archaeology), choose LiDAR. For visually rich models, general site mapping, or when budget is a primary concern, Photogrammetry is often the better choice. Sometimes, combining both yields the best results.

## 1. Slow & Steady Wins the Race

Avoid jerky movements. Smooth, slow pans, tilts, and reveals often look more professional and cinematic than fast, abrupt changes in direction. Practice deliberate control stick inputs.

## 2. Master the Orbit Shot

Circling a subject smoothly (the orbit or point-of-interest shot) is a classic drone move. Practice maintaining a consistent radius and altitude while keeping the subject framed. Many drones have automated modes for this, but manual control offers more flexibility.

## 3. Use ND Filters

Neutral Density (ND) filters are like sunglasses for your drone's camera. They reduce the amount of light entering the lens, allowing you to use slower shutter speeds (ideally double your frame rate, e.g., 1/50s for 24fps) for natural motion blur, a key component of cinematic video.

## 4. Plan Your Shots

Don't just fly around randomly. Think about your composition, the story you want to tell, and the specific shots you need. Scout locations (even virtually using maps) and plan your flight paths beforehand.

## 5. Vary Your Altitude and Angles

Mix up your shots! Combine high, wide establishing shots with lower, more intimate perspectives. Experiment with different angles to add visual interest and dynamism to your sequences.

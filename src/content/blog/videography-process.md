Ever wonder how those cool drone videos actually get made? It's not just about sending a drone up and hitting record (though that's part of the fun!). At Coalbanks Creative, we've got a process we follow to make sure everything runs smoothly and the final video for our Lethbridge clients is totally amazing.

We think it's helpful for you to know what goes on behind the scenes. It's all about turning your great ideas into eye-catching videos that get the job done. So, let's pull back the curtain on how we work!

## Our Not-So-Secret 3-Step Recipe for Drone Video Success

We break things down into three main stages: Planning (Pre-Production), Filming (Production), and Polishing (Post-Production). Getting each step right is key to ending up with a video you'll love.

**Step 1: Pre-Production – Getting Our Ducks in a Row (Planning is Everything!)**

This is where we figure everything out *before* the drone even leaves its case. Good planning makes the actual filming way smoother and ensures the final video is exactly what you're looking for.

*   **Let's Chat! (Understanding Your Goals):** First things first, we sit down and chat with you. What's this video *for*? Who needs to see it? What's the main message? Whether it's showing off a house, promoting tourism, tracking a build site, or making your Lethbridge business look great, knowing your goals is job number one.

*   **Rules, Rules, Rules (Safety & Legal Stuff):** Flying drones for business means following the rules. We take care of this boring-but-crucial part:
    *   **Transport Canada Check:** We make sure everything we do follows the official Canadian drone rules (CARs for RPAS, if you want to sound fancy).
    *   **Airspace Check & Permissions:** We check if we need special permission to fly where you want us to (especially near the Lethbridge airport!) and handle getting the okay.
    *   **Spotting Hazards:** We look over the filming location for anything tricky (like power lines or tall trees) and make a solid safety plan so everything goes smoothly and safely.

*   **Making a Plan (The Fun Part!):** Now we figure out how to make your video look awesome:
    *   **Checking Out the Spot:** We often use tools like Google Earth to get a sneak peek, and for trickier spots around Lethbridge, we might pop by in person to check lighting, obstacles, and the best angles.
    *   **Mapping Out the Shots:** We create a shot list (and sometimes little drawings called storyboards) so we know exactly what shots we need, how the drone should move, and how long each shot should be. It helps us be super efficient on filming day!
    *   **Chasing the Good Light:** That amazing "golden hour" light right after sunrise or before sunset? We try to plan shoots around then whenever possible – it makes everything look *chef's kiss*.

*   **Gear Check! (Making Sure Everything Works):** We give all our drones and cameras a good once-over:
    *   **Drone Health Check:** Make sure the drone itself is happy and ready to fly.
    *   **Battery Power-Up:** Charge up all the batteries (and bring spares!) so we don't run out of juice mid-shot.
    *   **Memory Card Prep:** Format the memory cards so they're empty and ready to capture all that amazing footage.
    *   **Smooth Moves Check:** Calibrate the camera gimbal (the bit that keeps the camera steady) for super-smooth, non-jittery video.
    *   **Drone Sunglasses (ND Filters):** Get the right ND filters ready based on the weather forecast, especially if it's going to be a bright Lethbridge day!

**Step 2: Production – Lights, Camera, Action (Drone Style!)**

This is where the magic happens! Our certified pilots head out and bring the plan to life, capturing those awesome aerial shots.

*   **Flying Like a Pro (with an Artist's Eye):** Our pilots aren't just steering; they're thinking like filmmakers:
    *   **Smooth Operator:** We focus on making those drone movements look fluid and intentional, not jerky like a first-time flyer! Getting those orbits, reveals, and tracking shots just right.
    *   **Using Smart Flight Modes:** Modern drones have cool features like following a subject or flying a pre-set path. We use these tools when they help get the perfect shot consistently.
    *   **Good Ol' Manual Skills:** Sometimes you just need that human touch! Our pilots are great at flying manually too, for those tricky shots or creative adjustments.

*   **Nailing the Camera Settings:** We put our planned camera settings into action, tweaking as needed for the conditions:
    *   **Keeping it Cinematic (24fps):** Sticking mostly to 24 frames per second for that movie look.
    *   **Getting the Motion Blur Right (1/50s Shutter):** Using ND filters to keep the shutter speed around 1/50th for smooth motion.
    *   **Low ISO = Clean Picture:** Keeping the ISO low for the best image quality.
    *   **Perfect Exposure:** Making sure the shot isn't too bright or too dark, using those handy ND filters on sunny days.

*   **Safety First (Still!):** Safety doesn't stop when the drone takes off:
    *   **Eyes on the Sky:** We often use a spotter – an extra person just watching the drone and the surroundings to catch anything the pilot might miss.
    *   **Watching Out for Surprises:** We keep an eye out for anything unexpected (like birds, other aircraft, or people wandering too close) and adjust the flight plan if needed.
    *   **Weather Watch:** We keep checking the weather, especially our famous Lethbridge wind! If things get dicey, we'll pause or reschedule to keep everyone safe and the footage looking good.

*   **Getting Plenty of Options:** We always shoot a bit more than we think we'll need:
    *   **"Just One More Take!":** We usually grab a few versions of each important shot, maybe trying slightly different angles or speeds. It gives us more choices when editing!
    *   **Shots for Smooth Edits:** We make sure to get extra footage (like wide shots or different angles) that helps connect the main shots smoothly later on.

**Step 3: Post-Production – Making it Shine!**

The drone might be back in its case, but the work isn't done! Now we take all that raw footage and turn it into a polished final video.

*   **Taming the Footage Files:** Drone video files can be huge! We get them organized:
    *   **Neat & Tidy Files:** We keep everything organized so we can find the shots we need easily. No digital mess here!
    *   **Making Editing Smoother:** Sometimes, especially with super high-res 4K video, we convert the files into formats that are easier for our editing computers to handle (like ProRes or DNxHD). It helps things run faster without losing quality. For really big projects, we might even make temporary low-res copies (proxies) to speed things up even more.

*   **Putting the Story Together:** This is where the magic really happens in the edit suite:
    *   **Picking the Best Bits:** Our editors sift through all the footage to find the absolute best takes that tell your story perfectly.
    *   **Making it Flow:** We arrange the clips in an order that makes sense and keeps people watching. Pacing is key – not too fast, not too slow!
    *   **Smooth Connections:** We use simple, clean transitions (like cuts or gentle fades) to move between shots smoothly, avoiding cheesy effects.

*   **Making the Colors Pop (Color Correction & Grading):** This step makes a HUGE difference:
    *   **Getting the Basics Right:** First, we make sure the brightness, contrast, and colors look natural and consistent across all the different shots.
    *   **Setting the Mood with Color:** Then, we get creative! We adjust the colors to give the video the right feel – maybe warm and sunny for tourism, or cool and crisp for something industrial. It really affects the vibe!
    *   **No Crazy Colors (Unless You Want Them!):** We aim for a polished, professional look, making sure colors look great whether viewed online or elsewhere.

*   **Don't Forget the Sound!:** Good audio is super important!
    *   **Finding the Perfect Music:** We help pick background music that fits the mood and visuals (and make sure it's properly licensed!).
    *   **Adding Realistic Sounds:** Sometimes adding subtle background sounds (like wind, birds, or city noise) makes the video feel more immersive.
    *   **Making it Sound Great:** We mix everything together – music, sound effects, maybe a voiceover – so it's clear, balanced, and sounds professional.

*   **Adding Extra Polish (Graphics & Effects, if needed):**
    *   **Text & Logos:** We can add clean-looking text on screen (like titles or names) or your company logo to make it look sharp.
    *   **Tiny Fixes (VFX):** If there's a tiny distracting thing in the background we couldn't avoid while filming, sometimes we can subtly remove it using visual effects magic. We try to keep it looking natural!

*   **The Final Check & Handover:** Almost there!
    *   **Double-Checking Everything:** We watch the video carefully one last time to catch any little mistakes.
    *   **Your Feedback Matters:** We'll share a draft with you to make sure you love it and make any reasonable tweaks you suggest.
    *   **Delivering the Goods:** We export the final video in the format you need (for web, social media, etc.) and get it to you securely!

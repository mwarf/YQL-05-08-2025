## Bringing Your Vision to Life

Creating compelling drone videography involves more than just flying a drone. At Coalbanks Creative, we follow a structured process to ensure your vision is realized effectively and professionally.

## Our Workflow Steps

1.  **Consultation & Discovery:** We start by understanding your goals, target audience, key messages, and desired visual style.
2.  **Planning & Storyboarding:** We develop a detailed flight plan, shot list, and storyboard (if needed) considering logistics, safety, regulations, and creative vision.
3.  **On-Site Filming:** Our certified pilots execute the flight plan, capturing high-quality raw footage using professional drone equipment and cinematic techniques.
4.  **Post-Production & Editing:** We meticulously edit the footage, incorporating color grading, music, graphics, and sound design to create a polished final product.
5.  **Review & Revisions:** We share a draft for your feedback and incorporate necessary revisions to ensure your complete satisfaction.
6.  **Final Delivery:** You receive the final video files in your desired format, optimized for web or broadcast use.

## Collaboration is Key

Throughout the process, we maintain clear communication, ensuring you're involved and informed every step of the way. Our goal is a seamless experience and a final video that exceeds your expectations.

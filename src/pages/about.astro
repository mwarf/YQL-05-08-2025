          Michael's story is a cool mix of tech smarts and a love for great visuals. He spent 20 years wrangling websites (leading teams at the U of L, designing for agencies, even running his own digital shop!), so he really gets how pictures and videos grab attention online. But he's also got a photographer's soul and a huge soft spot for Southern Alberta. That combo means we aim for real, authentic shots that truly capture the spirit of our region.

         <p>
           Look, we know there are choices. But we think we're pretty great! ðŸ˜‰ We don't just fly drones; we're storytellers using cool tech. We get what makes a Lethbridge property shine, how to capture the buzz of a local festival, or what farmers need to see from above. Plus, we do it right â€“ Michael's got the official <b>Transport Canada Advanced Certification</b>, we're fully insured, and safety is always top of mind.
       </p>
       <p>
         Most importantly, we like working <i>with</i> people. We want to hear your ideas, share what we know, and create awesome aerial stuff together that you'll be thrilled with.
